This excersis will help you understand how to draw visuals out of the dataframe using Python Programing language inside of Pandas software library.

        Dataframe: is simply data on a subject compiled into a table. For Pandas we will stick to Values and                      Points in time data frames because they are one dimensional. That is they are defined by one                    value. The table is made with rows and columns. Rows are left to right and Columns are up                      and down with in the table.

The Pandas Software Library sorts data in two types of time series arrays. 

        Arrays: are a rectangular arrangement of objects in equal rows (horizontal) and equal columns                               (vertical). Everyday examples of arrays include a muffin tray and an egg carton. An array                       of eggs. An array of juice boxes. An array of credit cards in a wallet.
        
        Time Series: Timestamped data is the most basic type of time series data that associates values with                        points in time. For pandas objects it means using the points in time. ... Timestamp and                        Period can serve as an index.
        
        Index: Indexing in pandas means simply selecting particular rows and columns of data from a DataFrame.                    Indexing could mean selecting all the rows and some of the columns, some of the rows and all                    of the columns, or some of each of the rows and columns. Indexing can also be known as                          Subset Selection.
        
        Object: What is a DataFrame object? Pandas offers two primary data structures: Series and the DataFrame                  objects. Whereas a Series represents a one-dimensional labeled indexed array based on the                      NumPy ndarray, a DataFrame object treats tabular (and multi-dimensional) data as a labeled,                    indexed series of observations. Two Dimensional Arrays
        
One Dimensional Arrays and Two Dimensional Arrays. One Dimensional dataframes use NumPy software library, which  adds support to Pandas for large, multi-dimensional (Two or More) arrays, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
